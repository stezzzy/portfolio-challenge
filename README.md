# <Responsive-CSS-Portfolio>

## Description

This Portfolio Website displays a responsive webpage with a functional navbar, a hero image, an about section, a my projects section, and a footer.

I built this project as a guideline for my future portfolio and to work on making it responsive and functional for future employers.
